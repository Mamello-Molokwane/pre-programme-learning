## My pre-program journey

### Week 1
    Learning git and it's concept helped me know more about storing your work more effectively
    and how you can go back and fix your mistakes or change your code. It's been a bit challenging
    especially with the ssh part but I'm coming along nicely and I do enjoy learning all these new things.

### Week 2
    On week 2 I finally started to code with the CS50P course and I'm starting on week 0. The concepts and projects aren't knew to me especially since we learned them in the bootcamp and I was able to complete the projects without much trouble.

### Week 3
    I reached week 1 of CS50P where they teach conditionals and even though it was also something I already knew from the bootcamp I learned about the match-case conditionals which seemed much easier
    than if-else but it only works in certain situation. The projects aren't that hard and everytime I
    complete a project there's this confidence boost I get from getting it right. Meal Time was a bit more challenging than the rest but it was still fun to complete.

### Week 4
    I completed week 2 of CS50P which was about loops, lists and dictionaries. This lesson helped me
    understand dictionaries better because I had trouble with printing values instead of the keys
    using loops but I know how to do that now. The problem set wasn't that hard but it was a little challenging when it got to vanity plates and I had to use a dictionary in nutrition which was 
    where I learned to access the values and not just the keys of a dictionary. Overall this was 
    also an enjoyable lesson.

### Week 5
    I completed week 3 of  CS50P which was about exceptions. I learned a lot about error handling and
    catching what I think is the most common type of error when it comes to user input, ValueError.
    Grocery and outdated were a bit more challenging especially outdated because the amount of ValueErrors
    I had to catch and handle. Even though they were more challenging solving them gave me the most confidence in error handling and using dictionaries. I enjoy week 3 and now onto week 4 of CS50P.

### Week 6
    Week 4 of CS50P complete. Week for was about libraries which was an interesting lesson and the problems most included the sys library. I'd say the only part challenging about these problem sets
    was having to learn about command-line arguments but once I got it it pretty simple. I did enjoy the
    bitcoin one from the probelem set. Learning about API's opens doors on what is possible and about a
    lot open source material out there.

### Week 7
    Completed week 5 of CS50P. The topic was on unit tests which is just creating a seperate file from your main code to test the main code. This lesson was relatively straight forward to learn compared to the others as there there's not much logic that you have to learn. The tricky thing about this lesson was that I had to restracture some of my past code to be able to test it, but other than that it was a breather.
