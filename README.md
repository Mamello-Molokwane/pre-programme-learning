## My pre-program journey

### Week 1
    Learning git and it's concept helped me know more about storing your work more effectively
    and how you can go back and fix your mistakes or change your code. It's been a bit challenging
    especially with the ssh part but I'm coming along nicely and I do enjoy learning all these new things.

### Week 2
    On week 2 I finally started to code with the CS50P course and I'm starting on week 0. The concepts and projects aren't knew to me especially since we learned them in the bootcamp and I was able to complete the projects without much trouble.

### Week 3
    I reached week 1 of CS50P where they teach conditionals and even though it was also something I already knew from the bootcamp I learned about the match-case conditionals which seemed much easier
    than if-else but it only works in certain situation. The projects aren't that hard and everytime I
    complete a project there's this confidence boost I get from getting it right. Programming is fun.

### Week 4
    I'm at week 2 of CS50P where they teach loops, list, dictionaries and other functions like len() and
    I'm starting to feel that it's getting more challenging with the projects, specifically meal time but
    I know finishing this is gonna give me more confidence with python so I'm excited to complete it.
